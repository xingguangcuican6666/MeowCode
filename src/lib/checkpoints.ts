// command — MeowCode's take on Claude Code's checkpoints. Before a mutating file
// tool (write_file / edit_file) runs, fs-tools snapshots the file's PRIOR state
// here (gated on ctx.rewind). `/rewind` lists those snapshots and can restore one,
// writing the old contents back (or deleting a file that didn't exist before).
//
// The store is module-level and in-memory: the tool loop and the command run in
// the same process, so both share it. It lives for the session only (a fresh
// process starts empty) — snapshots are not persisted to disk.
